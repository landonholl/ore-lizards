# Changelog

## 1.1.0

### Changed

- **Ore tint colors re-derived from the actual block textures.** Every variant's tint is now the
  mean of all pixels in that mineral's *solid block* texture from the client jar —
  `coal_block.png`, `diamond_block.png` and so on — rather than hand-picked values. The solid block
  rather than the ore block, since an ore block is mostly its stone matrix and averages out grey.
  For the three metals that have one, the *raw* block is the source (`raw_iron_block`,
  `raw_gold_block`, `raw_copper_block`), because raw metal is what those variants drop and it looks
  nothing like the refined bar — raw iron is a tan-brown where an iron block is near-white.
  Coal `2B2B2B`→`101010`, iron `B8B1AA`→`A6886B`, gold `FFED00`→`DEA92F`, redstone
  `9C0D0D`→`B01905`, lapis `1A51B8`→`1F438C`, diamond `54BFD9`→`62EDE4`, emerald
  `30A758`→`2ACB58`, copper `A75A2C`→`B0664D`. Copper is the one value that isn't a straight
  mean: `raw_copper_block` is speckled with green oxidation — a third of its pixels sit at hues
  of 46° to 161° — which pulled the mean to an olive-leaning `9A6A4F`, so it uses the mean of
  just its copper-hued pixels instead. These reach the model close to unchanged: the tint
  multiplies shard pixels averaging 229/255 and eye pixels averaging 252/255, so there is nothing
  meaningful to compensate for.

- **Drop counts are now tiered by ore.** Coal, iron, redstone, lapis and copper drop 4-6; gold,
  diamond and emerald drop 2-4, with a 2% chance of paying out 6 instead. Previously everything
  dropped a flat 1-3. The split is on the reasoning that a cheap ore is only worth killing for if
  you get a proper handful, whereas a valuable one is worth killing for at any amount — so those pay
  out smaller with an occasional windfall. Expressed as a `DropTier` on `OreVariant`, so a new
  variant declares which tier it belongs to and nothing else changes.

### Added

- **A light spark trail while the lizard is out of the ground.** Vanilla's `firework` particle, one
  every 3 ticks, emitted at mid-body height with no velocity so the sparks hang where the lizard
  was and mark its actual path — the point is to still be able to follow it after it rounds a
  corner in an unlit cave. Gated on the state machine (erupting, fleeing, digging down) rather than
  on whether it's currently moving, so it doesn't cut out exactly when the mob is cornered or
  pathing round an obstacle, which is when you're most likely to lose it. Never emitted while
  dormant, for the same reason the glow isn't.

### Fixed

- **The eruption played from the wrong place for its first quarter-second.** GeckoLib doesn't start
  an animation on its first frame: it spends the controller's `transitionLength` (5 ticks here)
  blending from whatever pose the model is currently in into that first frame, and only then starts
  the animation's own clock. `appear` opens with the body 13 units — 0.81 blocks — underground,
  while the pose being blended from was the bind pose at ground level, and the lizard is made
  visible on the same tick the state flips. The result was a lizard popping into view standing on
  top of the block, sliding down into it over five ticks, and only then erupting. The two state
  animations now run with a zero-tick transition so they begin on their own first frame. That also
  makes `appear` line up with `ERUPT_DURATION_TICKS` — both are exactly 1 second, where previously
  the transition ate a quarter of the eruption and the rise was cut off before it finished.
- **The lizard popped back above ground at the end of burrowing.** `thenPlay` is `PLAY_ONCE`, and
  GeckoLib stops the controller when a `PLAY_ONCE` animation completes, which drops the model back
  to its bind pose. `burrow` ends with the body 32 units (two blocks) down, so for the last ticks of
  `DIGGING_DOWN` — the animation is 20 ticks, the state lasts 30 — the lizard reappeared at ground
  level, in full view, before being discarded. Both one-shots now use `thenPlayAndHold`.

### Changed

- **Flee destinations are now chosen deterministically: the furthest reachable spot from the
  player.** The goal no longer asks `DefaultRandomPos.getPosAway` where to run. That draws ten
  *random* samples and discards any failing its pathability filters, so in a cave the player has
  opened up, the survivors are whatever the open corridor happens to offer — which made the choice
  of destination effectively arbitrary. It now sweeps 16 directions, probing each from its
  outermost ring inwards and stopping at the first standable column, then takes whichever puts the
  most distance between the lizard and the player. Anything no further away than the lizard already
  is gets rejected, so a direction that curls back towards the player can't win, and if nothing is
  reachable it still falls back to the random flee rather than standing still.
- **Flee scan distance capped at 12 blocks, to match what the pathfinder can actually deliver.** A
  mob's A* only expands nodes within `FOLLOW_RANGE` (16, Manhattan) of itself and gives up after
  `FOLLOW_RANGE * 16` = 256 nodes, so a target beyond that can never be reached — the search spends
  its entire node budget and returns a partial path regardless. Aiming inside that horizon means
  paths usually complete, which is cheaper and more predictable, and costs nothing in range because
  the lizard repaths every 10 ticks from wherever it has reached and only covers about six blocks in
  that time.

- **Flee repathing is now floored at 4 ticks.** The goal deliberately repaths early whenever the
  current path runs out, but a destination the navigator can't actually reach leaves `isDone()` true
  permanently — which meant a full escape-route search every single tick for the rest of the flee.
  Pre-existing, but four times more expensive now that the search draws multiple routes.

- **`maxUpStep` raised from the default 0.6 to 1.0, so the lizard steps over one-block rises instead
  of jumping them.** `MoveControl` only jumps when the next waypoint is higher than `maxUpStep`, so
  every ledge in an uneven cave floor was costing it a jump, and each jump bled the momentum that
  the flee speed boost had just given it. 1.0 is the value vanilla gives horses and ravagers. The
  same number feeds `WalkNodeEvaluator`, so its paths route over those rises as steps as well.

- **The ore shards and eyes are now emissive.** They were the parts of the mob meant to catch your
  eye, but lit normally against cave stone they are very easy to walk past. Both now get a second
  fullbright pass on top of the variant tint, so they glow in the dark rather than merely being
  brightly coloured. Drawn through `RenderType.eyes` — the same render type vanilla uses for
  enderman/spider eye overlays — which is fullbright and additive in vanilla, and which Iris and
  OptiFine route through their `gbuffers_spidereyes` program, so shader packs pick it up as a real
  emissive surface. GeckoLib's own `AutoGlowingGeoLayer` was the alternative, but it builds a
  custom render type shader packs have no convention for and needs a per-skin `_glowmask` texture,
  which would have cost the per-variant tinting. Glow strength is scaled to 70% so the brighter
  ores keep their hue instead of clipping to white; coal, being near-black, barely glows at all
  (its eyes included). Dormant lizards are explicitly excluded — a glow would defeat the
  camouflage outright.

## 1.0.0

First full release. The alpha had the mob's core loop working — spawn, erupt, flee, burrow, drop
ore — but it was static, silent, and effectively impossible to encounter in a real world. This
release makes it animated, audible, and actually findable.

### Added

- **`scuttle` walk-cycle animation.** Driven by GeckoLib's `isMoving()` (real velocity and
  limb-swing, the same signal vanilla mobs use), so it animates for any movement — fleeing,
  knockback, being shoved — not just its own AI state.
- **`appear` animation** on emergence, and **`burrow` animation** on digging back down. Both are
  one-shot and take priority over the movement animation so they can't be interrupted.
- **Spawn egg**, listed in the vanilla Spawn Eggs creative tab. Unlike `/summon`, it routes through
  `EntityType.spawn()` and therefore runs `finalizeSpawn`, so egg-spawned lizards get a proper ore
  variant, correct stone/deepslate attribution, and start genuinely dormant.
- **Digging sounds** when emerging and burrowing (`STONE_BREAK` / `DEEPSLATE_BREAK`, matching where
  it spawned), fired alongside the existing block-dust particle bursts.
- **Scuttle footstep sounds**, pitched up to read as a small skittering creature. Implemented via
  `playStepSound()`, which vanilla paces by distance travelled — so it automatically quickens with
  the flee speed boost rather than needing its own timer.
- **Ambient look goals** (`LookAtPlayerGoal`, `RandomLookAroundGoal`). These use the LOOK flag, not
  MOVE, so they run alongside fleeing rather than competing with it — they just stop it from
  looking like a statue while visible but stationary.
- **Panic on damage.** Taking any damage while dormant or emerging now immediately triggers a full
  flee response, targeting whatever hit it. Previously only player proximity could wake it, so a
  lizard struck by AoE damage just sat there.

### Changed

- **Spawn category `CREATURE` → `AMBIENT`.** `CREATURE` shares a single population cap with every
  surface animal, which is essentially always full by the time a player reaches a cave — meaning
  the lizard could go a whole session without a single spawn attempt regardless of weight. `AMBIENT`
  is the category vanilla's Bat uses for exactly this reason.
- **Spawn range widened from `Y < 0` to `Y < 50`**, now gated on being at least 8 blocks below the
  terrain surface rather than on raw depth. Depth-below-surface is used instead of a sky-light check
  because it works during worldgen before lighting is computed, and it ignores player torches.
- **Stone/deepslate attribution is now Y-based** (`Y < -4`) rather than sampling the block below.
  -4 is the midpoint of 1.20.1's stone→deepslate blend band, so it tracks what the surrounding rock
  actually looks like, and costs one comparison instead of block lookups at spawn time.
- **Despawning is now underground-aware.** Lizards never despawn while the nearest player is still
  below ground, and only start rolling to despawn once that player has surfaced. The check runs
  every 5 seconds instead of vanilla's every-tick nearest-player scan, with the heightmap lookup
  gated behind both a tick check and a distance check.
- **Spawn rate reduced by 30%** via a roll in the spawn predicate (spawn weights are integers and
  ours was already at the floor of 1, so the reduction couldn't be expressed as a weight).
- **Flee pathing repaths as soon as its current path completes**, instead of waiting out a fixed
  10-tick timer. In tight caves the old behaviour left it standing still mid-escape.
- **Emergence lengthened from 10 to 20 ticks** to match the `appear` animation's full 1-second
  length, so it no longer gets cut off partway through.
- **Creative and spectator players are ignored entirely** — they can't wake a dormant lizard by
  walking past, and can't damage one.
- Ore tint colors darkened slightly (gold lightened) for better contrast against the rock.

### Fixed

- **Dormant lizards were visible in the wild.** `LivingEntity.updateInvisibilityStatus()` re-evaluates
  the invisibility flag every tick as `setInvisible(hasEffect(INVISIBILITY))`, silently wiping the
  one-time `setInvisible(true)` from `finalizeSpawn` on the very next tick. This also caused the
  "teleported into the ground" effect on trigger: the lizard sat visible at rest pose, then snapped
  down when `appear`'s first keyframe (0.81 blocks underground) took over.
- **The burrow animation never played.** Entity state was a plain unsynced field, only ever updated
  inside the server-gated half of `tick()`. Animation controllers run on the client, whose copy of
  the state was permanently stuck at its initial value — so the "is it digging down?" check was
  never true. State is now synced properly.
- **Creative players still triggered dormant lizards** despite the exclusion, because
  `getNearestPlayer`'s boolean parameter has the opposite polarity to how it reads (`false` excludes
  only spectators). Now uses vanilla's named `EntitySelector.NO_CREATIVE_OR_SPECTATOR`.
- **Suffocation while dormant and burrowing.** Vanilla damages any entity whose hitbox overlaps a
  solid block; the lizard is exempt except while fleeing in open air.
- **Tail never animated.** The model's tail had been split into a `tail_01`/`tail_02`/`tail_03` bone
  chain, but the generated geometry still had a single static `tail` bone — so the animation's tail
  channels targeted bones that didn't exist and were silently discarded.
- **Animation lookups failed silently**, spamming `Unable to find animation` every frame, from a
  mismatch between the animation names in code and the actual keys in the exported file.
- **The stone variant could never spawn.** 1.20.1 replaces stone with deepslate below Y=-8, so the
  old `Y < 0` rule confined every natural spawn to deepslate — making the stone texture and its
  whole variant table (including coal, which deepslate excludes) unreachable.
- Dormant lizards could be shoved around and blocked movement despite being invisible.
